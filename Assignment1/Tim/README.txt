COMP 345 Assignment 1

README

By default, the program is configured to run the supplied CPPUnit tests along with 
2 additional CPPUnit test cases added by me. In order to run a driver which will allow
run through a test of each dice type, comment out the "#define TEST" statement on line 
#35 in runApp.cpp then recompile the program. 

It is assumed the CPPUnit libraries and includes are installed and properly configured
in the project being used for testing (as discussed with Dr Paquet in lecture)
